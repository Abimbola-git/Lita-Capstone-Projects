         	Product information (product ID, category, price). 
   
         	Store location data (region, store ID). Format: CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, (SQL) database.
  	


   
3.	  Data Preparation, Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading
   
         •	Data Cleaning: 

         •	Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns. 

         •	Handle missing values (e.g., impute, remove). 

         •	Data Transformation: 

         •	Convert date fields to a standard format. 

         •	Create calculated columns (e.g., total sales = quantity sold × price).
  	



4.	  Overall Revenue Data Analysis
   
      Top-Selling Products:

         	 Identify the products with the highest sales figures. Analyze sales by product category. 

      Regional Performance: 

         •	Compare sales across different regions. Identify regions with the highest and lowest sales. 

      Monthly Sales Trends: 

         •	Create a time series analysis of monthly sales. Identify seasonal patterns

   

5.	  Key Metrics
   
         	Used Excel spreadsheet and SQL database 
         
         o	To analyze the total sales revenue

         	Line Chart: Monthly sales trends. 
   
         	Card Visuals: Key metrics (total sales, average transaction value). 
   
         	Interactivity: Use slicers for filtering data by product category, region, or time period


  	  Conclusion: This structured approach helps to effectively analyze the sales performance of the retail store and create an insightful Power BI dashboard.
